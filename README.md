📁 Project Structure
👉File of dataset:
hotel_bookings.csv — original data file with hotel booking records
cleaned_hotel_bookings.csv — cleaned version of the data for analysis
👉Python scripts for each step of the project:
01_DataViewing.py — view and understand the data
02_DataCleaning — files to clean and prepare the data
03_EDA — exploratory data analysis (examples of patterns and charts)
04_DescriptiveStatics — calculations of basic statistics 

📌What This Project Does
View Data : 
The data is loaded using pandas to see the first and last rows.
The number of rows and columns is shown.
Basic information about each column’s type and missing values is printed.
Clean Data : 
Unwanted or missing values are fixed so the dataset is easier to analyze.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : 
Patterns, trends, and relationships in the data are explored using charts and tables.
Descriptive Statistics : 
The project calculates important statistics such as : Mean (average), Median, Frequencies and counts and Other summary values

🔎Tools Used : 
Python — main programming language
pandas — library for data loading and cleaning
(Optionally) other Python libraries for graphs and statistics : mathplotlib, seaborn

🥰How to Run :
1️⃣Clone this repository to your computer.
2️⃣Put the CSV files in the same folder as the Python scripts.
3️⃣Run the Python files in order:

Start with 01_DataViewing.py

Then the other scripts for cleaning and analysis
